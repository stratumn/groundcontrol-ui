          Before you can start working on cool apps, you need to add some sources.
          Sources contains workspaces which let you work on projects.

        Ground Control is an application to help deal with multi-repository development
        using a user friendly web interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Workspaces are defined using YAML files which can easily be shared.
        A workspace contains multiple projects.
        A project corresponds to a reference (such as a branch or tag) of a repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ground Control user interface allows you to perform operations across the projects of a workspace,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clone all repositories (defaults to $HOME/groundcontrol/workspaces/WORKSPACE/PROJECT)</li>
        <li>Check the status of repositories against their origins</li>
        <li>Pull all outdated repositories</li>
        <li>Define workspace wide tasks</li>
        <li>Create scripts to launch multi-repository applications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Good luck and happy coding!
